# FAQ  
  
Q.) Who will the TA's be?  
A.) For TA's, we will be using an Airbnb/Uber type model, where graduate students and educators at other school, colleges, or universities will be paid to grade assignments on a per assignment basis. A 1 page paper could pay $1 to grade, and a 5 page paper could pay $5. These numbers are purely hypothetical at this point and should not be taken as promise of payment.
